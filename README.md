#Life

## Simulation based on the work of the Mathematician John Conway's Life.

##Rules
	1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
	2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
	3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

	Condensed as:
	1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
	2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
	3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
